# Fixture QA test plan

## Source of Intent

- Intent: `_docs/intent/Template/intent-qa-finalization/decision.md`

## Quality Goal

Validate that a complete QA test-plan fixture passes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC-001: The fixture includes acceptance criteria.

## Intent-derived Invariants

- INV-001: QA docs must remain live quality records.

## Risk Assessment

Risk: Medium.

## Test Strategy

Use `validate-qa.mjs` in fixture mode.

## Test Matrix

| ID | Source | Requirement / Invariant | Test Type | Command / File | Expected Evidence | Status |

| AC-001 | fixture | Valid QA test-plan passes. | validator | `deno run --allow-read scripts/validate-qa.mjs _evals/validator-fixtures/qa/valid` | Validator exits 0. | planned |
| INV-001 | intent | QA docs are not archived. | validator | `deno run --allow-read scripts/validate-qa.mjs _evals/validator-fixtures/qa/valid` | Canonical QA path is accepted. | planned |

## Manual QA Checklist

## Regression Checklist
